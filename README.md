**C for Natural Sciences**

Anubrajo Ghosh | MCBA Semester 2 | St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata

MDS Paper: AI for Natural Sciences | Academic Year 2025-2026

# **1\. Project Overview**

C for Natural Sciences is a multi-module interactive study application built with Streamlit and Python, designed as a submission for the MDS (Multidisciplinary Studies) paper - AI for Natural Sciences - at St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata. The application serves as a structured, self-contained learning platform covering the C programming language from foundational syntax through to advanced bioinformatics-relevant programming techniques.

The core premise is that C - despite being a 1972 language - remains the computational backbone of modern bioinformatics. Tools like BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner), SAMtools, BLAST, and htslib are all written in C. Understanding C is therefore not an academic exercise for a Microbiology student - it is practical preparation for the genomic data pipelines used in real research.

**Key proposition:**

Every module pairs its C programming concept with a concrete Microbiology or Bioinformatics application - so the student always knows why each concept matters to their degree, not just how it works.

- Protein Molecular Weight Estimator - using average residue masses minus peptide bonds

# **7\. Application Architecture**

### **7.1 Entry Flow**

- User lands on splash page (app.py) - sidebar hidden via CSS injection
- Background image (loading_bio.jpg) is base64-encoded into a CSS &lt;style&gt; block
- User clicks 'Click Here' → st.session_state.entered = True → st.rerun()
- Loading animation (st.status) runs once; st.session_state.initialized = True
- Sidebar appears; user selects chapter from radio menu → module.render() called
- Auto-scroll JS fires on every render to return the user to the top of the page

### **7.2 Session State Variables**

| **Variable**                 | **Purpose**                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| st.session_state.entered     | False = show splash; True = show main app          |
| st.session_state.initialized | False = run loading animation once; True = skip it |

### **7.3 Module Import Strategy**

Python prohibits importing modules whose filenames start with a digit. The solution uses importlib.import_module() with the full dotted path:

gen = importlib.import_module('chapters.1_generations')

This loads the file chapters/1_generations.py and assigns the module object to gen. Calling gen.render() then executes that module's render() function. Every chapter file exposes exactly one public function - render() - keeping the interface consistent.

### **7.4 Visual Design System**

| **Element**          | **Specification**                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary brand colour | #00599C (C Programming blue)                                        |
| Dark accent          | #002D5A                                                             |
| Light background     | #F0F4F8 / #E8F0FE                                                   |
| Header blocks        | Background #00599C, border-left 10px #002D5A, white text            |
| Section dividers     | Blue 3px left border on info/callout blocks                         |
| Code blocks          | st.code() with language='c' for C syntax highlighting               |
| Info callouts        | background-color: #E8F0FE, border-left: 3px solid #00599C           |
| MDS box              | background-color: #F0F4F8, border: 1px solid #00599C                |
| Font                 | Sans-serif (Streamlit default); Courier New for code in HTML blocks |

# **8\. Installation & Local Setup**

### **8.1 Prerequisites**

- Python 3.10 or higher (preferably Python 3.12)
- pip (Python package manager)
- A terminal / command prompt
- Git (optional - for cloning from GitHub)

### **8.2 Step-by-Step Setup**

- Clone or download the repository:

`git clone <https://github.com/Anubrajo-Ghosh/streamlit-c-for-natural-sciences.git>`

`cd streamlit-c-for-natural-sciences`

- Create a virtual environment (recommended):

`python -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate` # Linux / macOS

`venv\\Scripts\\activate` # Windows

- Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Place the background image in the project root:

Ensure loading_bio.jpg is in the same directory as app.py. If the file is absent, the splash page loads without a background - no crash occurs.

- Run the application:

`streamlit run app.py`

- Open in browser:

Streamlit will print a local URL (typically <http://localhost:8501>). Open it in any modern browser.

### **8.3 requirements.txt**

`streamlit>=1.32.0`

No additional Python packages are required. All mathematical rendering uses Streamlit's built-in LaTeX support. The C code displayed in the app is static text - it does not compile or execute within the application.

# **9\. Deployment on Streamlit Cloud**

- Push the project to a public GitHub repository.
- Go to community.streamlit.io and sign in with GitHub.
- Click 'New app' → select your repository → set Main file path to app.py.
- Click 'Deploy'. Streamlit Cloud reads requirements.txt and installs dependencies automatically.
- The app will be live at https://&lt;your-app-name&gt;.streamlit.app within 1-2 minutes.

**Important notes for deployment:**

• loading_bio.jpg must be committed to the repository (it cannot be uploaded separately to Streamlit Cloud).

• The free Streamlit Cloud tier has a 1 GB memory limit - this app uses well under 100 MB.

• The app sleeps after 7 days of inactivity on the free tier. Visiting the URL wakes it within ~30 seconds.

• All 16 chapter files must be inside a chapters/ directory at the repository root.

# **10\. Key Design Decisions**

### **10.1 Why Streamlit?**

Streamlit was chosen because it allows a Python/science-oriented developer to build a functional interactive web application without any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript expertise beyond occasional inline HTML for custom styling. A semester 2 student with Python familiarity can maintain and extend it easily.

### **10.2 Why one render() function per module?**

Each chapter file exposes exactly one public function - render(). This creates a clean contract: app.py calls module.render() and the module handles everything else internally. Adding a new chapter requires only creating a new file and adding two lines to app.py (the import and the menu entry).

### **10.3 Why importlib instead of a standard import?**

Python's import system does not allow identifiers that begin with digits. Since chapter filenames follow the pattern 1_generations.py, 2_history.py etc. (matching the natural module numbering), importlib.import_module('chapters.1_generations') is the clean solution - no renaming or sys.path hacks needed.

### **10.4 Why not execute the C code in the browser?**

Executing arbitrary C code in a web application introduces security risks (sandbox escapes, denial-of-service) and significant infrastructure complexity (requires a C compiler backend, process isolation, timeout management). The application is a study platform - the C code is the content to be read and understood, not executed. Students compile and run the programs locally using GCC or any C99+ compiler.

### **10.5 Colour choice - #00599C**

The primary brand colour (#00599C) is the exact blue used in the official C programming language logo. Using it consistently throughout headers, borders, callout boxes, and buttons ties the visual identity directly to the subject matter - making the design choice conceptually motivated, not arbitrary.

# **11\. How to Compile & Run the C Programs**

The C programs displayed in the application are intended to be copied and compiled locally. All programs are standard C99 or C11 and compile with GCC, Clang, or MSVC.

### **11.1 Basic compilation (GCC)**

`gcc -std=c99 -o program program.c`

./program # Linux / macOS

program.exe # Windows

### **11.2 Programs using &lt;math.h&gt; (requires -lm on Linux/macOS)**

`gcc -std=c99 -o growth growth.c -lm`

### **11.3 Recommended compiler flags for study**

`gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o program program.c -lm`

\-Wall -Wextra enables all warnings. -pedantic enforces strict standard compliance. These flags help catch bugs that would otherwise compile silently.

### **11.4 Online compilers (no local installation needed)**

- Programiz Online C Compiler - programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler
- GDB Online - gdbonline.org

# **12\. Known Limitations**

- C programs are display-only - they cannot be compiled or executed within the application itself.
- However all the C Programs included have been verified and tested. If required they can be tested on any onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler.
- The background image on the splash screen must be manually placed at the project root; it is not embedded in the Python source.
- Tab 3 of the Lab Repository uses Variable-Length Arrays (int arr\[n\]) which are C99/C11 only, optional in C11, and not available in C17+. A portability note is displayed in the module.
- The auto-scroll JavaScript uses window.parent DOM manipulation which may behave differently across Streamlit versions. A try/catch fallback is included.
- Streamlit's free cloud tier puts the app to sleep after 7 days of inactivity - the first visit after a sleep period takes ~30 seconds to load.

# **13\. Academic Context & Declaration**

This application was developed as a project submission for the MDS (Multidisciplinary Studies) elective paper 'AI for Natural Sciences' during Semester 2 of the B.Sc. programme at St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata.

The content covers the prescribed C programming syllabus and extends it with biological context appropriate to a Microbiology major. All C programs in the Lab Repository have been verified for correctness. The biological formulas (Michaelis-Menten, exponential growth, generation time, pH, Beer-Lambert) are standard undergraduate biochemistry and microbiology equations.

**Declaration:**

This project is an original submission. The application code, module content, quiz questions, and biological commentary were developed by Anubrajo Ghosh for the 2025-2026 academic session. External references include the C standard documentation (ISO/IEC 9899), ANSI C specification (C89/C90), and standard microbiology textbooks.
